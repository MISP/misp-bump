# MISPbump
Simple and secure synchronisation of MISP instances

# What is MISPbump?
With MISPbump admins can easily synchronize MISP instances by exchanging relevant information via encrypted QR codes.

Note: only **use case 1** from the [documentation](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/sharing/) is supported.

# How does MISPbump work?
First of all: MISP admins login by providing the base URL of their instance and their authkey (automationkey).

On a successfull login the admins profile and the linked organisation information will be downloaded automatically.  
This information can be updated at any time in the profile screen.

In the main screen you can start a synchronisation process by pressing the dedicated button.

The synchronisation process consists of 3 steps:
1. **Key Exchange**  
    To provide a secure chanel for data exchange, the first step is to generate a shared secret with [Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) ([Elliptic Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)).

    Public keys are exchanged via QR code.

1. **Synchronisation Information Exchange**  
    Contains the following information:
    + Own Organisation: Name, UUID, description, nationality, sector, type and contacts
    + Own User: Email
    + Own MISP instance: base URL
    + Generated: sync user authkey, sync user password  
        (your partner will create a sync user with these credentials)

    The synchronisation information is encrypted with AES using the shared secret (from step 1).

    The sync process information will be saved securely on the device, that means the upload can be started any time in the future.


1. **Upload information to own MISP instance**  
    Uploading the information to the MISP instance is accomplished with MISP's REST API.

    Uploading consists of the following steps:
    1. Create organisation
    1. Create sync user & add to organisation
    1. Create sync server & populate with information above

After that the two MISP instances are connected.
