# MISPBump

With MISPBump it is easy to share events on your MISP instance with other instances. Instead of generating organisations, sync-users and sync-servers you scan only two QR-Codes and the job is done.

# How does it work?


# Security

A keyagreement is realized with Diffie Hellman (Elliptic Curve 256 Bit), and the data sent afterwards is encrypted with AES.
